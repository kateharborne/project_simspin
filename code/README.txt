This directory contains all of the code required to generate the plots in the 
<project_simspin/paper> directory.

This code is written in the coding language R and uses the R-package "magicaxis"
to generate plots. First, the SimSpin observation data in <project_simspin/data>
is generated using the files:

- case_study_1.R
- case_study_2.R
- case_study_3.R
- case_study_4.R

These files should build mock observations used in the examples in Section 3.1 
of the paper. 

For constructing the observed kinematic maps from the spectral data cubes, it is
necessary to run pPXF. The code used to do this is written in python and makes 
use of the pPXF package and EMILES templates included within this repository. 
The pPXF output is generated (with the SimSpin data above as input) using the 
files:

- case_study_1_ppxf_fits.ipynb
- case_study_2_ppxf_fits.ipynb
- case_study_3_4_ppxf_fits.ipynb

The files generated by these scripts are stored in 
<project_simspin/data/cubes/ppxf_output/> and can be used in the following 
plotting scripts to generate the plots in the paper:
